# Tracking Seismic Activity

## The Challenge
The United States Geological Survey(USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The challenge is to build a new set of tools in HTML/CSS/Javascript that visualize their earthquake data on an interactive dashboard. 

## File Directory
- `index.html` contains the `.html` script for our homepage
- static folder contains our `.js`, `,css`, and our data(json) files

## Process
- Fetched the json data from USGS site
- Cleaned,sorted, filtered through the data
- Created a map using Leaflet that plots earthquakes based on longitude and latitude
- Structured markers that reflect magnitude and depth by size and color
- Scripted tiles that allows users to toggle additional layers to the map for added visuals

## Results
